### Circle of 5th

You have to memorize it (you should know it cold)

Order of sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#

Order of flats (reversed order of sharps): Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb, Fb

So, if we have 4 sharps in the key: take first 4 sharps, E major for example has F#, C#, G#, D#

#### What you do with this once you know it?

##### Triads:

Major: I, IV, V

Minor: ii, iii, vi

Dim (diminished): vii•

##### Sevenths chords

Maj7 = Imaj<sup>7</sup>, IVmaj<sup>7</sup>

Minor7 = ii<sup>7</sup>, iii<sup>7</sup>, vi<sup>7</sup>

Dom (dominant) = V<sup>7</sup>

Half Diminished = VII<sup>7b5</sup>

##### You have to know how to spell them in major key.

##### You have to know corresponding modes in every key, this shows you relationship between modes and chords:

* Imaj7 = Ionian

* ii<sup>7</sup> = Dorian

* iii<sup>7</sup> = Phrygian

* IVmaj<sup>7</sup> = Lydian

* Vmaj<sup>7</sup> = Mixolydian

* vi = Aeolian

* ​vii = Locrian

For example: if you are in a key Bbmaj (B flat major), the 4th chord (E flat lydian) is the 4th mode of B flat major. Let's say you are in the key F major and you wanna know ii mode — it's G dorian.

### Chord progression

Let's say we have this chord progression: (Song: all the things you are) (First 5 bars).

|​ vi<sup>7</sup>    | ii<sup>7</sup>  |   V<sup>7</sup>      |   Imaj<sup>7</sup> |

| Fm<sup>7</sup>    | Bbm<sup>7</sup> |   Eb<sup>7</sup>     | Abmaj<sup>7</sup>  | 

|​ IVmaj<sup>7</sup> |

| Dbmaj<sup>7</sup> |

You have to know what key it is. The first step is to look to a Dominant chord, so it's Eb7, Eb7 is the Vth chord only in one key. So the scale that you play over each of these chords corresponds with scale that goes within these roman numerals. 

So **vi** mode is Aeolian, we play F Aeolian. 

ii<sup>7</sup> we play Bb Dorian, then Eb Mixolydian, Ab Ionian and Db Lydian.

So, if you are soloing over this progression you gonna play: F Aeolian, Bb Dorian, Eb Mixolydian, Ab Ionian, Db Lydian.

So you need to understand chords — scale relationship.

All these 5 chords were in Ab major scale. Now let's add more chords to this progression:

<u>C major:</u>

|ii<sup>7</sup>  |  V<sup>7</sup>  | Imaj<sup>7</sup> |

|Dm<sup>7</sup>  |  G<sup>7</sup>  | Cmaj<sup>7</sup> |

Dor,  Mix,  Ionian — scales to play over these chords

This is just basic knowledge you have to have: the chord — scale relationship.

#### How do you build these chords? (10:00)

###### Triads:

Major = 1 3  5 or M3 → m3 and P5 (perfect 5th) between 1 and 5

Minor = 1 b3 5 or m3 → M3 and P5 between 1 and 5

Aug (Augmented) =  1 3 #5 or M3 → M3 and A5 (augmented 5th) between 1 and 5.

Dim = 1 b3 b5 or m3 → m3 and d5 (diminished 5th) between 1 and 5.

This is how you build basic triads.

###### Other triads: (13:20)

Sus<sup>4</sup> = 1 4 5, C F G in the key of C.

Lyd<sup>▵</sup> (triad) = 1 #4 5, C F# G in the key of C.

Phrg<sup>▵</sup> = 1 b2 5, C Db G in the key of C.

Sus<sup>2</sup> = 1 2 5 (it's an inversion of Sus<sup>4</sup>).

Q (quartal voicing) = 1 4 b7 (two P4)

Q<sup>+</sup> = 1 4 7 (P4 → A5)

###### Sevenths chords (15:22)

Maj<sup>7</sup>  = 1 3 5 7

Maj<sup>7#5</sup> = 1 3 #5 7

Dom<sup>7</sup> = 1 3 5 b7

Dom<sup>7#5</sup> = 1 3 #5 b7

Dom<sup>b5</sup> = 1 3 b5 b7

Min<sup>Maj7</sup> = 1 b3 5 7

Min<sup>7</sup> = 1 b3 5 b7

Min<sup>7b5</sup> = 1 b3 b5 b7

Dim<sup>7</sup> = 1 b3 b5 bb7 (double flat 7)

These are basic seventh chords that everybody should know.

###### Upper extensions (19:00)	

C<sup>7</sup> = C E G Bb Db D#

1 2  5 b7  b9  #9

#### Inversions

Cmaj<sup>▵</sup> = C E G (root position)

E G C, E C G (1st inversion)

G C E, G E C (2nd inversion)		

Any combination of these 3 notes is a C major chord, doesn't matter what inversion it is.

When you have 4 note chord you have extra inversions there.

Cmaj<sup>7</sup> = C E G B

##### Common progressions

In rock you have: I, IV, V

In jazz you have: 

ii7, V7, Imaj7,
 
iii, VI, ii, V, Imaj7

I, vi, ii, V

ii<sup>7b5</sup>, V<sup>7b9</sup>, i<sup>7</sup>
